# DropBear Codex  
DropBear Codex is a .NET library designed to enhance application reliability and data integrity. It introduces a robust system for operation results handling, supporting generic result types with integrated payload data integrity verification via checksums. The library is equipped with custom MessagePack serialization for complex types, ensuring efficient and secure data transfer.
  
## Features  
- Generic result types (`Result`, `Result<T>`, and `ResultWithPayload<T>`) to represent the outcomes of operations clearly.
- Integrated checksum for data integrity verification in `ResultWithPayload<T>`.
- Custom MessagePack formatters for serialization and deserialization of complex and custom types.  
- Extensions for ASP.NET Core and asynchronous programming, facilitating seamless integration.
  
## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get DropBear Codex running in your project for development and testing purposes.
  
### Prerequisites
- .NET 6.0 SDK or later  
- An IDE like Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider
  
### Installing
1. Add DropBear Codex to your .NET project via NuGet:
```shell
dotnet add package DropBear.Codex
```
2. Use the library in your project by adding the appropriate `using` statements:
```csharp
using DropBear.Codex.Core.ReturnTypes;
using DropBear.Codex.Core.Extensions;
```
  
## Usage
  
### Basic Usage
Utilize `Result` and `Result<T>` for simple operation outcomes:  
```csharp
public Result PerformOperation()
{
    // Operation logic
    return Result.Success();
}

public Result<string> GetOperationData()
{
    // Operation logic
    return Result<string>.Success("Operation data");
}
```
  
### Advanced Usage with Payload
Use `ResultWithPayload<T>` for operations that require data integrity checks:
```csharp
public ResultWithPayload<MyDataType> GetSecureData()
{
    MyDataType data = new MyDataType();
    // Populate data
    return ResultWithPayload<MyDataType>.Success(new Payload<MyDataType>(data));
}
```
  
## Running the Tests
Run the automated tests for this system using the following command:
```shell
dotnet test
```
